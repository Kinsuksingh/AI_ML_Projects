#### This dataset is a synthetically generated dataset for training a logistic regression model to predict heart disease.

Columns:

* age: Age in years
* sex: 1 = male, 0 = female
* cp: Chest pain type (1-4)
* trestbps: Resting blood pressure
* chol: Serum cholesterol
* fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false)
* restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results Â  
 (0-2)
* thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved
* exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)
* oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise
* slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment (1-3)
* ca: Number of major vessels (0-3)
* thal: Thalassemia (3 = normal, 6 = fixed defect, 7 = reversible defect)
* num: Diagnosis of heart disease (1 = heart disease, 0 = no heart disease)

The data is generated randomly within realistic ranges based on common heart disease characteristics. The 'num' column is assigned based on a predefined probability threshold for heart disease.
